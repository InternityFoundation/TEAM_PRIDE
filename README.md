## Project Name
Neat Freak (Mobile application-an initiative for Swachh Bharat)

### Project Objectives
There can’t be two opinions on the importance of cleanliness. A clean country means healthy citizens and is always a motivation. But nowadays, our public places have become dumping yards for waste.Our roads, our rivers have become dirty.
For uniform cleanliness in a country it is essential to have a standard operating procedure where Government and Citizens work together to ensure the best possible outcomes for the country.

## AIM
We are planning to build a mobile app that will use AI and ML to motivate the citizens (to become a Neat Freak) and cleanliness
departments to have a healthy competition among themselves to work for the betterment of the country. The app enables a citizen to post a “Swachh” issue by just clicking the picture and posting it on the app with their location on.

The issues of concern can be-
1. Garbage Disposals.
2. Improper maintenance of Public Toilets and Sewage System.
3. Lack of Cleanliness among the Public Hospitals.
4. Maintenance issues at Construction Sites.
5. Unnecessary wastage of water resources by polluting them.
6. Or other thousands of issues which are of environment concern.

The app will automatically detect the problem described by the picture and raise an alarm to the concerned department by tagging them in it. This makes the easy User Experience. The mobile app would contain the Statistics of the every Department and Authorities that how much is the each Department receiving the problems and to what extent they are solving them. They would be given “actively engaged percentage” based on their issues resolvable ability so the citizens and the seniors come to know about the Ground Reality. This way the whole system would be transparent. At the end of the year , based on the ‘activeness score’ of the Authorities , the one which makes it to the top would get huge amount of money from the Government as an incentive to motivate the officials to work harder rather than depending upon the
bribes and not working for the country.

### Research Work
For converting the image uploaded by the citizens automatically to precious data and making aware the concerned Authorities would use ML and AI part that we are implementing using theGoogle’s “Show and Tell” algorithm which can describe the contents of a photo with staggering 94% accuracy and that will help to identify that the photo is concerned to the problem of which Authority.

Concerned Departments and Authorities can be-

1. Ministry of Environment and Forests
2. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3. Ministry of Railways
4. Shipping, Road Transport and Highways
5. Ministry of Water Resources
